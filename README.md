# data-science-and-DL
This repo contains a couple of select projects I found interested that I completed while working with various data science and learning tools in Python and Jupyter.

The midterm project contains an in-depth look at former President Trump's tweets (while his Twitter was still active), containing analysis of his overall sentiment of tweets, which devices/clients he used most when tweeting. what time of day he tweets most frequently,  and comparison of his bias towards certain media outlets.

The final project contains a deep learning model written with TensorFlow that classifies images in the FasionMNIST dataset based on what each image most likely represents, walking through the development of such a model from creating a linear regression model, to implementing a k-means methodology of clustering, to finally using our model for predicitons.
